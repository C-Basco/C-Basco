### Hi there, I'm Constance Basco ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who is continously learning and growing. Here on my github you will see different projects ranging from data analytics to machine learning and of course my main skill pathway... software engineering. 

When I'm not learning and working I enjoy:

- :video_game: Playing Video Games (Trying to get through the souls games) 
- :clapper: Video Editing 
- :books: Reading
